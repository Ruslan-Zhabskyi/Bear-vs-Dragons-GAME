Brief description of the game developed 1/2 sentences: 
=========================
The goal of the game is for the Hero to avoid collision with oncoming Villains while shooting them 
with acorns to score points.  Collecting rain drops at the beginning of each game can increase the Hero's 
number of lives.

Keystrokes/Mouse:
=========================
The Hero can move using the LEFT and RIGHT cursor keys and jump with the UP key. 
To shoot acorns press the SPACE bar.

Known bugs/problems:
=========================
-->Collision detection between Hero and Rain needs adjustment to detect rain touching any part of the Hero. 
-->Space bar can be used as the confirmation option in a dialog window may not be ideal for the user experience 
if the "No" option is preferred
